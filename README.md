ðŸ‘‹ Howdy! I'm Zac. I'm an engineering leader at GitHub working on Repos and SDLC projects.

I was previously at [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) as the lead for [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/?nav=min) and [Azure Repos](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/repos), and before that I spent a decade working on data visualization and devops at [SAS Institute](https://github.com/sassoftware), including [Visual Analytics](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/visual-analytics.html). 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about devops, industrial-strength SDLC, compilers and data visualization!
