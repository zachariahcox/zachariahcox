# skip-level 1:1 agenda seed
Skip-level 1:1s are your time to do with as you choose. 
The catch is that you want to make it a good use of company time too. 
From your perspective, is there anything we should do more of? less of? differently? 
Are there products we should make? stop making? 
What's on your skip-level's mind? What are their biggest concerns? 

### 5m intros / elevator pitch
* In your own words are you presently in your career?
* What job-related skills are you currently working on? 
* Tell me about yourself so we can get to know each other better as humans (beyond work)

### What’s on your mind? 
* What kind of stuff are you working on? 
* What’s going well?
* What’s something that's part of your job that just makes you go UGH.
