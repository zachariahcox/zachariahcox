## Problem / Context (pick one)

What are we doing here?
Summarize the fewest concepts needed to understand why we should invest here at all.
Keep this section short, and **put all URLs** in the resources section at the bottom. 
You don't want people to get distracted and leave.

## Proposal

What can we do to fix this?   
What are the main pros and cons to the approach?   
How will data flow?

Diagrams and screenshots are important here. 
Use something cheap like:
* [mermaid diagrams](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams)
* [excalidraw.com](http://excalidraw.com) 

This document can be used to drive the decision itself.
If there are multiple options on the table, **write them both up** for discussion and use this document to wrangle feedback.  
When we ultimately decide on one, move the rest to the "Alternatives considered" section below.

## Scenarios

Identify all key "use cases," flows, or behaviors needed and briefly describe how your solution does or does not address them.
Call out any big pros and cons. 

_Push_ your reviewers to help you fill in this section to the best of our collective ability.
Often, the quality of the overall product is limited by our understanding of the key scenarios.

### 1\. Key thing that has to work

Setup: 

* Step 1  
* Step 2

The proposal would handle this by X, Y, Z.

### 2\. Another Key thing that has to work

...

## Alternatives considered

Move options that were discussed and rejected down.   
Ideally capture the reasoning behind the choice.

## Resources 

* URLs to relevant documents.   
* If using slack channels, take a screen shot for posterity.
