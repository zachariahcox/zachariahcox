1. create new feature in "proposal" or "shaping" mode
1. finalize details with stakeholders
1. create slack channel (usually with pattern `team-featurename`), and add stakeholders
1. create collaboration document for capturing meeting notes
1. set document url as topic of the channel
1. schedule one-time kick off meeting and regular engineering-product-design sync meetings (probably weekly)
1. demo results and gain final approval from product
2. monitor telemetry for aggreed-upon period of time
3. archive channel and doc when project is rolled out
