# my expectations


### honesty / information stability 
I try to be as transparent as possible, and I expect the same from you.

I encourage you to reach out to my manager if you're curious about something and do not feel comfortable asking me for some reason. 

I think you'll need a effective relationship with both of us to be maximally successful anyway.

We should socialize the best information we have -- while targeting to an audience is important, we should strive to deliver the same news, good or bad, to all levels of the org chart.

### results-focus
I care about the results -- the work that we do each day should easily align with at least one of our Objectives and Key Results.
If you feel like your current work does not align with those goals, oh no! We should discus it!

### engineering / observability focus
Under normal circumstances, we should not be adding to our technical debt. 
Code is meant to be read by humans. It will be read more times than it was written, so optimize for the future reader (especially if that's you!).
PR. When you open a PR, mentally switch roles and review the content from the reviewer's standpoint. 

All new code contributions should be accompanied by high-quality unit testing and built behind feature flags. The deployment strategy should include enough telemetry to diagnose problems in production. And hopefully charts and graphs. I highly recommend building dashboards!

### iterative focus
In general, projects that can be delivered iteratively are going to be: 
1. easier to build
1. easier to deploy (and roll back)
1. easier to parallelize amongst your team.

### kindness
I expect you to help your fellow team members when they need it! 
Everyone needs help sometimes, and we should take the opportunity to practice our technical communication skills whenever the need arises.
Keeping the team unblocked and deliberately creating a culture where asking questions is encourage are our goals. 

### diversity and inclusion
Diversity and commitment to inclusion are important to 
building good teams. Our goal is to create an environment where everyone can do their best work. 

Sometimes misunderstandings will happen!

I expect you to be respectful of someone's lived experiences and to pay attention to the power dynamics present in our interactions in terms of race, gender and gender expression, sexual identity or expression, class, disability, religion, age, body size, etc.
