### Top of mind

* How'd you invest your time this week?

### Top accomplishments

* This is not a laundry list of work, but an upward-focused summary, suitable for framing.
* Generally these should be in the same "language" we used to scope, negotiate and schedule the work.
* Should take the format: [preview, ga, platform]: link to feature issue: your short comments on exactly how awesome this is.
* Videos are helpful where they make sense.

### Update on in-progress work

* link to feature issue
  * Current "trend" status as a color (green / yellow / red)
  * Current "target date" when we think the work will be complete (or quarter if not this quarter)
  * Definitely call out any challenges, concerns or date changes.
