## onboarding new hires

The first weeks after joining a new team can be daunting. 

The goals of onboaring are to teach the new team member both the mechanical requirements of developing the feature (working with our tooling, finding code, etc) 
and how we develop features (how to find people who know things, cultural expectations around paired programming, documentation and communication expectations, etc.).


## the "good first issue" project

* The ideal first issue is simple, well-defined and visible (demoable).

* You and the new hire are jointly responsible for their first project. They will get all the credit for success, but you will absorb at least some responsibility for failure.

* velocity is a goal -- try to keep scope creep under control. A common source of scope creep is the new hire misunderstanding the goals of the feature, or not feeling comfortable pushing back on stake holders. Use your leverage as a known figure on the team to drive for right-sized deliverables.
