# Setup Scripts

This folder contains automated setup scripts for configuring new development environments.

## Why This Is Public

These scripts are intentionally kept in a public repository because they contain **no sensitive information**. They only include:

- Package managers and tool installations
- Common development tools and utilities
- Public configuration settings
- Environment setup commands

**What's NOT included:**
- Passwords, API keys, or credentials
- Private company information
- Proprietary software or configurations
- Personal or sensitive data

By keeping these scripts public, they can be:
- Easily accessed from any new machine during setup
- Shared with team members or the broader community
- Version controlled and improved over time
- Referenced as examples for others setting up similar environments

## Files

- `winget-setup.ps1` - Windows package manager setup script

## Usage

Review each script before running to ensure it matches your needs, then execute with appropriate permissions for your platform.
