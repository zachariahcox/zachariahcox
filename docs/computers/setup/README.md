# Setup Scripts

This folder contains automated setup scripts for configuring new development environments.

These scripts are intentionally kept in a public repository because they contain **no sensitive information**. They only include:

- Package managers and tool installations
- Common development tools and utilities
- Public configuration settings
- Environment setup commands
- Acquiring other private repos that contain further setup instructions.
